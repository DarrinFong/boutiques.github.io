    <p>
    Porting applications to science gateways is a critical step to
    enable their execution on distributed computing infrastructures
    and their sharing among scientific communities.  However,
    application porting remains a costly human effort that consists of
    1) installing the application on the target execution platform, 2)
    describing the application in a format compatible with the science
    gateway, and 3) generating proper user interfaces. Due to the
    variety of science gateways, application porting efforts are often
    replicated several times while mutualization would save cost and
    improve the quality of the ported applications. Boutiques is
    an application repository that allows automatic import
    and exchange of applications in science gateways. Compared to
    previous initiatives, our repository relies on Linux containers to
    solve the problem of application installation in a lightweight
    manner. In addition, it adopts a flexible application description
    format which is versatile enough to be used in various science
    gateways. We demonstrate the relevance of boutiques by describing
    11 applications from the epigenetics and neuroimaging domains, and
    by importing them in the Pegasus WMS, CBRAIN, and VIP science
    gateways automatically and at a reduced human cost
